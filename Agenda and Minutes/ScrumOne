Scrum 1 Agenda and Minutes
Started Scrum at 11:17 am on the 21st of June

We decided to move the inventory management page into Sprint 2 due to Sprint 1 being overstuffed.
We decided to condense the number of tasks from the repitive ones into more general one.
We have also decided on Epics to help sort everything by their pages (i.e. Manager, Checkout, APIs, Inventory, etc.).

Our Agenda for this Sprint:
Checkout Page
Login Page
Manager Menu
Setup
Styling

End of the Day Agenda: 
Finalize the login page
